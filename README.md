# Pharmउपाय - Plant Disease Detection App

---

## Overview

Pharmउपाय is a mobile application designed to aid farmers and gardeners in identifying plant diseases quickly and accurately. By simply taking a photo of a plant leaf or affected area, the app utilizes advanced image processing techniques and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model - VGG-19, to analyze the image and detect potential diseases present in the plant.

This project was initially developed as part of the Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2023, aiming to address the challenge statement provided by the Ministry. Although the problem statement backing out halted the full development, our team is committed to continuing the project in the future, recognizing its potential to significantly impact agricultural practices.

## Future Development

Despite the setback faced during SIH 2023, our team remains dedicated to further developing Pharmउपाय to its full potential. We aim to:


- **Educational Resources**: In addition to diagnosis results, the app offers educational resources such as information about detected diseases, their symptoms, and potential treatments, empowering users with knowledge to combat plant diseases effectively.
  
- **Expand Disease Database**: Continuously enrich the database with additional plant diseases to enhance the app's diagnostic capabilities.

- **Enhance Model Performance**: Refine the CNN model and incorporate more advanced algorithms to improve accuracy and speed of disease detection.

- **Integrate Feedback Mechanism**: Implement a feedback mechanism where users can provide input on diagnosis results, helping us refine and improve the app's performance over time.

- **Collaborate with Experts**: Forge partnerships with agricultural experts and researchers to ensure the app remains up-to-date with the latest advancements in plant pathology.
